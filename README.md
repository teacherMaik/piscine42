## A collection of my exercises from participating in the 42 School piscine in Madrid

\<Hello World\><br />
\<Hello Madrid\>

26 days of non-stop learning. I made it to C08, where I finished just before learning about Malloc and memory allocation. All exercises were done on Macs (unix). I started the piscine with no knowledge of terminal commands nor C as a programming language, as you will see in the lines of code.

I passed all 4 exams and was accepted into the 42 school.
